The Antiguan racer is harmless to humans and has a gentle temperament.[3] It is diurnal, being active from dawn to dusk.[3] At night, it rests in a hidden shelter.[3] The Antiguan racer appears to have poor resistance to common snake mites, which are not naturally found in Antigua, which has ended some attempts at captive breeding.[6]

The racer primarily eats a diet of lizards, including the local Antiguan ground lizard.[3] While the species sometimes hunts for its food, it is typically an ambush predator, waiting for prey with most of its body buried beneath leaves.
