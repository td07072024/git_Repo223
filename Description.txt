This racer exhibits sexual dimorphism.[3] The adult racer is typically about 1 m long, with females being larger than the males.[3] Young adult males are usually dark brown with light creamy markings, while young females are silvery-gray with pale brown patches and markings.[3] Females also have larger heads than the males.[4] However, older individuals of both sexes can be highly variable in colour hue and pattern, and are frequently heavily speckled or blotched in a range of hues, including white, taupe, reddish brown, brown, and black.
